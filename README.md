## Wireframing issue 🚀

You have been presented with a design for a new website. Your buddy Elon has signed it off, and just needs you to finish off the home page, but he is very particular, it needs to be EXACTLY like the design.

Check out [design-challenge](/design-challenge/) for the design and preview of the animation.

## JavaScript Problem - Two Sum ➕

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in an array like so: [index1, index2].

There is a stretch goal, once you solve it, ask Sam it will be revealed to you!

There are answers for this all over the internet, don't cheat, it won't help you learn!

## Recreate a classic 🕹️

Create one (or more?!) of the following:

- Rock-Paper-Scissors
- Calculator (stretch, scientific)
- Naughts & Crosses
- Pong
- Whac-a-mole
- Stopwatch

The rule here is you CAN use Google, but you CAN'T google "how to make an X". As above, there are tutorials for how to do these all over the web, do not use one.  

## Practice so you can apply your knowledge more confidently 🏋️ 🤸   

Sometimes you just need to practise something. To make up some examples of it.
After that you need to apply it - by creating something with it. 
Well Gimme 5 is about practice. Simple, repetitive, self-guided practice.
